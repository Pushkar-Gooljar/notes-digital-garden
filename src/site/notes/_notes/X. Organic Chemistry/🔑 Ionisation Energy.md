## First Ionisation Energy
- First ionisation energy is the energy required
- To remove one electron from each atom
- In one mol of atoms of an element in the gaseous state
- To produce one mol of gaseous +1 ions

$$
\large
\ce{X_{(g)}->X+_{(g)} + e-} \space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{1} = + E\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
**Examples of first ionisation energies:**
1. Hydrogen
$$
\ce{H_{(g)}->H+_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{1}  = + 1310\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
2. Silicon 
$$
\ce{Si_{(g)}->Si+_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{1}  = + 786\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
3. Chlorine 
$$
\ce{Cl_{(g)}->Cl+_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{1}  = + 1260\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
> [!tip]
> - Ionisation energy is **always endothermic** as energy is **required** to remove electrons
> - Element and ion should be in gaseous state, state symbols **ARE** required
> - Use the symbol of the **element** itself, **not a molecule**; For example, for diatomic elements like $\ce{H_{2}}$ or $\ce{Cl_{2}}$ use $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{Cl}$ respectively
> - It is best practice to have the electron on the $\mathrm{RHS}$ ($\ce{X+_{(g)} + e-}$) rather than on the $\mathrm{LHS}$ ($\ce{X_{(g)} - e-}$)


## Successive Ionisation Energies
- Once one electron has been removed from a neutral atom to form a +1 ion, more electrons can be removed forming +2, +3 ions and so on until there are no more electrons left to remove.
- Hydrogen only has the first ionisation energy as it only has 1 electron, Helium only has first and second, and so on.

**Examples of successive ionisation energies:**
1. Second ionisation energy of carbon
$$
\ce{C+_{(g)}->C^{2+}_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{2}  = + 2350\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
2. Third ionisation energy of silicon
$$
\ce{Si^{2+}_{(g)}->Si^{3+}_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{3}  = + 3230\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
3. Fourth ionisation energy of sulfur 
$$
\ce{S^{3+}_{(g)}->S^{4+}_{(g)} + e-}\space \space \space \space \ce{IE_{4}  = + 4540\space kJmol^{-1}}
$$
>[!tip]
>Only **one** electron should be removed at a time, for example, writing the second ionisation energy of calcium as follow:
>$$\ce{Ca_{(g)}->Ca^{2+}_{(g)} + 2e-}$$
> Is wrong, because removing two electrons from a neutral calcium atom to form a $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ ion is not the second ionisation energy, the second ionisation energy is removing 1 electron for a $\ce{Ca+}$ ion to form $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$


### Enthalpy change for successive ionisation energies
- For the first ionisation energy, the enthalpy change is equal to the first ionisation energy itself ($\ce{IE_{1}}$).
- For the second ionisation energy, the enthalpy change is equal to $\ce{IE_{1} + IE_{2}}$
- And so on for more successive ionisation energies.


## Factors influencing ionisation energy
- Ionisation energy depends on the force of attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged outermost electron (how hard it is to remove the electron).
- The following factors impact ionisation energy by making this force of attraction stronger or weaker:
	1. Distance from nucleus
	2. Nuclear charge
	3. Shielding effect from inner electrons
	4. Spin-pair repulsion
	5. Presence of subshells

### 1. Distance from nucleus 
- The further an electron is from the positively charged nucleus, the weaker the electrostatic attraction between them. 
- This means less energy is required to remove the electron.
- **Effect on $\ce{IE}$ :** As distance between outermost electron and nucleus increases, $\mathrm{IE}$ generally decreases.
### 2. Nuclear charge
- A greater number of protons in the nucleus results in a stronger positive charge, which in turns exerts a stronger electrostatic attraction on the electrons. 
- More energy is required to overcome this stronger attraction.
- **Effect on $\ce{IE}$ :** As nuclear charge increases (e.g. across a period), $\ce{IE}$ generally increases.

### 3. Shielding effect from inner electrons 
- Inner shell electrons repel outer shell electrons, effectively "shielding" them from the full attractive force of the nucleus.
- The more inner shells there are the greater the shielding effect. 
- This reduces the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons, leading to a weaker electrostatic attraction with the nucleus.
- Less energy is needed to overcome this weaker attraction.
- **Effect on $\ce{IE}$ :** As number of inner shells increase (e.g. down a group), $IE$ generally decreases.

> [!success]- Extra Info
> - Slater's Rules are a set of empirical rules used to estimate the effective nuclear charge ($\mathrm{Z_{eff}}$) felt by an electron in a multi-electron atom.
> - Formula: the general formula is $\mathrm{Z_{eff}= Z-S}$, where:
> 	- $\mathrm{Z}$ is the atomic number (number of protons)
> 	- $\mathrm{S}$ is the shielding constant, which quantifies how much the other electrons reduce the nuclear attraction.
> - How $\mathrm{S}$ is calculated: Slater's Rules assign specific shielding contributions from different electrons based on their positions relative to the electron being considered:
> 
> | Principal Quantum Number of Electron | Contribution to shielding constant |
> | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
>| $\mathrm{n}$                         | 0.35                               |
>| $\mathrm{n-1}$                       | 0.85                               |
>| $\mathrm{n-2}$ and beyond            | 1.00                               |
> >[!example] 
> >- Consider the outermost electron of sodium ($\ce{Na}$)
> >- To calculate the effective nuclear charge we need to calculate the shielding constant
> >- The electronic configuration of sodium is $\mathrm{1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^1}$
> > $$ \begin{align}S &= 8(0.85) + 2(1.00) \\&= 8.80 \\Z_{eff}&=Z-S \\&= 11 - 8.80 \\&= 2.20\end{align}$$
>>
>>- Therefore the outermost electron in sodium only experiences an effective nuclear charge of 2.20 due to shielding, which is considerably lower than the actual nuclear charge of 11

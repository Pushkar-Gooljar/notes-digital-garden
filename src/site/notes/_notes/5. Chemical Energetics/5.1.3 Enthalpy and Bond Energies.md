- **Energy transfers** occur during chemical reactions because of the **breaking** and **making** of chemical bonds.

# Bond Breaking and Bond Forming
## Bond Breaking
- Covalently bonded atoms are held together by **strong electrostatic forces of attraction**
- Energy must be **supplied** (in the form of heat) to overcome the electrostatic attraction between nuclei and shared electrons. (i.e. energy is supplied to do work in breaking bonds)
- Since energy is supplied to the [[_notes/5. Chemical Energetics/5.1.1 Enthalpy Change#^3b55f7\|system]] from the surroundings, bond breaking is **endothermic**

## Bond Forming
- Individual unbonded atoms (free radicals) have an unstable high energy state
- Atoms bond together to achieve a lower more stable energy state.
- In doing so, the excess **energy is released**
- Since energy is **released** from the [[_notes/5. Chemical Energetics/5.1.1 Enthalpy Change#^3b55f7\|system]] to the surroundings, bond forming is **exothermic**

## Enthalpy Change of Overall Reaction
- If **more energy is required to break bonds** than energy released when bonds are formed, the reaction is **endothermic**
- If **more energy is released** when bonds are formed than energy required to break bonds, the reaction is **exothermic**

# Enthalpy Calculations
## Exact Bond Energy
- The amount of energy required to break **one mole** of a **specific** covalent bond in one mole of molecules in the **gas phase** is called the **bond dissociation energy**
- Bond dissociation energy is also known as the **exact bond energy** or **bond enthalpy**

## Average Bond Energy
- Bond energies are affected by other atoms in the molecule
- The strength of a particular bond is slightly different in different compounds
- Therefore an **average** of a number of the **same type** of bond but in **different molecules** is calculated 
- This average is known as the **average bond energy**

>[!info] Note
>Since bond energies cannot be directly measured, they are calculated using **enthalpy cycles**


>[!attention]
>Since bond energies are defined as the amount of energy needed to **break** bonds, bond energies are **endothermic** ($\Delta H = +ve$)

## Calculating Enthalpy Change from Bond Energies
- Bond energies are used to find the $\Delta H^{⦵}_{r}$ of a reaction when this cannot be done experimentally. (e.g. Haber Process)
- The following equation is used to calculate the standard enthalpy change of reaction using bond energies:
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta H^{⦵}_{r}&=\text{enthalpy change for bond breaking} + \text{ enthalpy change for bond forming} \\
\end{align}
$$
